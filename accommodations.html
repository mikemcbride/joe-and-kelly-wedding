<p class="lh-copy">Joe and Kelly booked a hotel. They didn't pay for it, really they just told some hotel people that there would be a large number of people they know coming and staying at their hotel all on the same date. If you have severe FOMO you can join this group and also stay at the hotel. It might be fun. They probably have an indoor pool.</p>
