  "joe": `I remember this beautiful girl catching my attention.
    What I didn't know was that she was a fellow law student.
    Over time, we slowly got to know each other and I realized just how awesome she was.
    Kelly was fun to hang out with (whether it be tailgating football games or sharing Pickleman's pizza together),
    a truly selfless person (she spent her free time tutoring local elementary school kids and coaching swimming for Special Olympics),
    very intelligent (she was a wiz in the classroom and still the smartest person I know),
    strong in her faith, and always there for her family.
    It is a pretty amazing feeling to know that this is the person I am supposed to spend the rest of my life with.
    I surprised Kelly on the four year anniversary of our first date.
    She had no idea. All I remember was choking through the words,
    trying to tell her how much I love her, and her reaction was priceless.
    After the initial shock wore off, she said yes.`,
  "kelly": `Joe and I met in law school.
    I said I wasn't going to date anyone in law school and then we met the Thursday of orientation and I had to eat my words.
    Joe's impeccable dance moves were what first caught my attention (if you haven't had the pleasure of seeing these, let me know - I've got PLENTY of videos).
    
    I knew pretty early on Joe was my person.
    He is very funny, intelligent and thoughtful.
    He keeps me on my toes and challenges me.
    We have been able to do some big, fun things - like trips to New Orleans, Cancun, etc. - but have some of the best times making homemade margaritas, salsa and tacos.
    He comes from a big family so I always felt right at home with them.
    
    When Joe proposed, I was shocked.
    We don't celebrate anniversaries (or even have one) so I didn't think he remembered what that day was.
    He got down on one knee, asked me to marry him and my response wasn't my finest moment ("holy s*@$" on repeat), but I still said yes eventually and that's what counts.`
