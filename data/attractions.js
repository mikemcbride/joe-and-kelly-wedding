    bbq: "No trip is complete without some BBQ. Head to the iconic gas station for the best in town – Joe's KC (formerly Oklahoma Joe's). Pro tip – call ahead, skip the line. And order the Z-Man with pork.",
    fun: "Check out the College Basketball Experience and Hall of Fame at the Sprint Center. Be sure to bring your basketball shorts – this experience is interactive. I took my brothers and taught them all how to properly dunk.",
    drink: "Up/Down – like Chuck E. Cheese, but for adults. This bar has tons of old school video games, including X-Men, Mortal Kombat, NBA Jam, NFL Blitz, the Simpson's, and more."

    bbq: "Q-39; also try Beer Kitchen in Westport if you are wanting something that isn’t BBQ.",
    fun: "You can see the Christmas lights (and do some shopping) on the Plaza; Union Station also has some pretty Christmas decorations and there is an outdoor ice skating rink nearby.",
    drink: "Green Lady Lounge for fancy cocktails; Kelly’s in Westport is always a fun bar for live music (and Kelly’s ironically has Joe’s pizza available to order inside the bar)"
