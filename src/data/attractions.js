    "bbq": "No trip is complete without some BBQ. Head to the iconic gas station for the best in town – Joe's KC (formerly Oklahoma Joe's). Pro tip – call ahead, skip the line. And order the Z-Man with pork.",
    "fun": "Check out the College Basketball Experience and Hall of Fame at the Sprint Center. Be sure to bring your basketball shorts – this experience is interactive. I took my brothers and taught them all how to properly dunk.",
    "drink": "Up/Down – like Chuck E. Cheese, but for adults. This bar was tons of old school video games, including X-Men, Mortal Kombat, NBA Jam, NFL Blitz, the Simpson's, and more."

    "bbq": " I already called dibs on Joe’s. You are a q-39 girl anyway.",
    "fun": "no idea. Maybe check out the Christmas lights on the plaza or Union Station cause it will be that time of year.",
    "drink": "my guess is Julep or Green Lady Lounge. You should pick your bar though, Kelly’s."
