He’s a man of great character and integrity, and always has my back. I couldn’t have asked for a better friend and brother.",

John is the life of the party and always speaks his mind with reckless abandon. He was frequently the butt of our jokes growing up (and still is). John is a great guy, always fun, and bound to make you laugh, even at inappropriate times. And he’s still never beaten me at one-on-one basketball.",
