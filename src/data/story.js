  "joe": `I remember this beautiful girl catching my attention.
    What I didn’t know was that she was in law school.
    Over time, we slowly got to know each other and I realized just how awesome she was.
    Kelly was fun to hang out with - tail gating at football games and eating Picklemans pizza,
    a truly selfless person - volunteering her time tutoring kids or coaching Special Olympics swimming,
    a wiz in the classroom – she is still the smartest person I know, strong in her faith, and always there for her family.
    I pinched pennies after law school in order to lock her down for life. I played it cool for months, and Kelly was none the wiser of my plan.
    I surprised her on the four year anniversary of our first date. Kelly had no idea.
    All I remember was choking through the words, trying to tell her how much I love her, and her reaction was priceless.
    After the initial shock wore off, she said yes. [put in proposal pic?]`,
  "kelly": "[good luck.]"
