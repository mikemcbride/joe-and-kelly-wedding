  "joe": `I remember this beautiful girl catching my attention.
    What I didn't know was that she was in law school.
    Over time, we slowly got to know each other and I realized just how awesome she was.
    Kelly was fun to hang out with - tail gating at football games and eating Picklemans pizza,
    a truly selfless person - volunteering her time tutoring kids or coaching Special Olympics swimming,
    a wiz in the classroom â€“ she is still the smartest person I know, strong in her faith, and always there for her family.
    I pinched pennies after law school in order to lock her down for life. I played it cool for months, and Kelly was none the wiser of my plan.
    I surprised her on the four year anniversary of our first date. Kelly had no idea.
    All I remember was choking through the words, trying to tell her how much I love her, and her reaction was priceless.
    After the initial shock wore off, she said yes. [put in proposal pic?]`,
  "kelly": `Joe and I met in law school.
    I said I wasn't going to date anyone in law school and then we met the Thursday of orientation and I had to eat my words.
    Joe's impeccable drunk dance moves were what first caught my attention (if you haven't had the pleasure of seeing these, let me know - I've got PLENTY of videos).
    
    I knew pretty early on Joe was my person.
    He is very funny, intelligent and thoughtful.
    He keeps me on my toes and challenges me.
    We have been able to do some big, fun things - like trips to New Orleans, Cancun, etc. - but have some of the best times making homemade margaritas, salsa and tacos.
    He comes from a big family so I always felt right at home with them.
    
    When Joe proposed, I was shocked.
    We don't celebrate anniversaries (or even have one) so I didn't think he remembered what that day was.
    He got down on one knee, asked me to marry him and my response wasn't my finest moment ("holy s*@$" on repeat), but I still said yes eventually and that's what counts.`
